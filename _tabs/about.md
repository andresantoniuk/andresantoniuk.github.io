At the intersection of technology and business strategy, I leverage over 25 years of experience to drive innovation and growth.

My career spans multiple industries, where I've held key corporate leadership roles, including CTO, CEO and also founded my own ventures. In these positions, I specialized in leading technical teams, defining strategic technology roadmaps, and delivering high-impact projects. My expertise includes legacy modernization, cloud/hybrid infrastructure, data analytics, and high-availability enterprise mission-critical systems, with a constant focus on achieving business objectives.

I am also a happy Linux user since 1999, with hands-on experience in embedded Linux, kernel drivers, DevOps, and software development. I thrive on transforming complex technical challenges into strategic business advantages.
