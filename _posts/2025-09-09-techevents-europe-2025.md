A [few days ago I shared](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andresantoniuk_still-as-a-student-i-saw-patricia-corbo-activity-7362185402742464512-aj8V) that tech events are "*invaluable opportunities to expand your perspective and connect with inspiring people"* and that is effectively what I experimented during my recent attendance to [Linux Foundation Europe](https://www.linkedin.com/company/automotive-grade-linux?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) and [PyData Berlin](https://de.linkedin.com/company/pydata-berlin?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) events.

This was my first time participating in events without a specific objective so I was completely open to listen, discover and learn. I had the opportunity to remember and connect with some of the different challenges I had during my professional life:

- **Music & MIDI**: still at university [I implemented a MIDI controller](https://youtu.be/m-jzb7WLXag) in a Motorola HC11 microprocessor. It was a great opportunity to attend [Titouan Christophe](https://linkedin.com/search/results/companies/?keywords=Titouan%20Christophe) talk [on MIDI2 on Linux](https://osseu2025.sched.com/event/25VwR/midi2-in-the-real-world-with-zephyr-titouan-christophe-mind).
- **Embedded Linux**: in 1999 I managed to run an embedded linux-from-scratch and even wrote kernel drivers [on a single-board-computer](https://www.compulab.com/1999/07/22/compulab-introduces-the-worlds-smallest-embedded-pc/) from [Compulab • C-LAB](https://il.linkedin.com/company/compulab?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) for my engineering thesis. I later used that for a project with [Andres Plaza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aplaza?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) and [José Miguel Piquer](https://cl.linkedin.com/in/jpiquer?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) at [Universidad de Chile](https://cl.linkedin.com/school/uchile/?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention). Now I learned about [The Yocto Project, A Linux Foundation Project](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yocto-project?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) and [The Zephyr Project](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-zephyr-project?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention).
- **Automotive**: [listening](https://osseu2025.sched.com/event/25Vuq/automotive-grade-linux-evolution-and-lessons-learned-from-10-years-of-community-management-walt-miner-the-linux-foundation) about [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.linkedin.com/company/automotive-grade-linux?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) made me go back to my work on Brazilian telematics mandate, the [implemented protocol test tools](https://github.com/andresantoniuk/acp245) (cc [Gustavo Lima Ferreira](https://linkedin.com/search/results/companies/?keywords=Gustavo%20Lima%20Ferreira)). At that time we used an [NXP Semiconductors](https://nl.linkedin.com/company/nxp-semiconductors?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) reference implementation for e-call and it was nice to see them now supporting [The Zephyr Project](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-zephyr-project?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention).
- **M2m & IoT**: [Nordic Semiconductor](https://no.linkedin.com/company/nordic-semiconductor?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) stand and talking with the guys from [Embeint](https://au.linkedin.com/company/embeint?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) brought back [good memories](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andresantoniuk_entre-cosas-viejas-encontr%C3%A9-esta-tarjeta-activity-7362543389189271553-qAHI) with my remote metering days both with [THE ZIGBEE ALLIANCE COMPANIES](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-zigbee-alliance-companies?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) and [ORBCOMM](https://www.linkedin.com/company/orbcomm?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention). Also i the breakfast chat with [Adam Dunkels](https://se.linkedin.com/in/adam-dunkels?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) on his experiences with IoT was enriching.
- **DevOps & infrastructure**: I really enjoyed the chat with [Nicky Pike](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicky-pike?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) from [Coder](https://www.linkedin.com/company/coderhq?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) about new trends and tools for software development lifecycle in this AI age. Furthermore, the chat with [Bouke van der Meer](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/bouke-van-der-meer?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) woke an interest in [Apache Flink](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apache-flink?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention).
- **Data, Analytics, Observability**: after several years of focusing in [Elastic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/elastic-co?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) I learned about [OpenSearch Project](https://www.linkedin.com/company/opensearch-project?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention). [Mehdi Ouazza](https://be.linkedin.com/in/mehd-io?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) workshop on [DuckDB](https://nl.linkedin.com/company/duckdb?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) was really enjoyable. Chatting with [Matthaus Krzykowski](https://de.linkedin.com/in/matthauskrzykowski?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) lead me to read about [dltHub](https://de.linkedin.com/company/dlthub?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention).
- **Fintech**: Hearing about [FINOS](https://www.linkedin.com/company/finosfoundation?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) and having the opportunity to speak with [Gabriele Columbro](https://www.linkedin.com/company/elastic-co?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) took me back to 2014, when I started with [Mifos Initiative](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mifos?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention). I also finally had the chance to meet [Robert Jakech](https://linkedin.com/search/results/companies/?keywords=Robert%20Jakech) from [Fiter](https://uy.linkedin.com/company/fiter-io?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) in person.
- **Legacy Modernization**: it came to me as a surprise that there were several instances talking about how mainframe, Cobol and related stuff are still relevant for our day by day, and how Linux and [AI can be used](https://aideveu2025.sched.com/event/25TtF/reverse-engineering-using-llms-vutukuri-sreenivas-stackup) to update those environments. That reminds me of the successful migration from openVMS to Linux on cloud [I lead some years ago](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andresantoniuk_dilbert-comic-strip-on-january-26-1991-activity-6985562722809622528-2Iwd).

[AI_DEV](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/ai-dev-europe/) gave me the opportunity to invest time listening directly to relevant actors such as [Mark Collier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markcollier?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) , [Malte Pietsch](https://de.linkedin.com/in/maltepietsch?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention), [Nicky Pike](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicky-pike?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) , [Emmanouil (Manos) Koukoumidis](https://linkedin.com/search/results/companies/?keywords=Emmanouil%20(Manos)%20Koukoumidis). It's a topic everyone is talking about, but only a few truly understand.

However, the events didn't just offer great technical content; I also had the chance to connect with several inspiring people and enjoy social moments.

Now that I'm back home, I'm ready to put all my new business ideas into action.
