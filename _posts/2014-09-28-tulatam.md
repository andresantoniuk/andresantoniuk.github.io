This week on [Telematics Update Telematics LATAM](http://www.telematicsupdate.com/latam/) conference an interesting discussion was if carmakers will continue to be relevant or if technology players will take pole position in future mobility.

Borders between traditional automotive and telecommunications/software industries are not there anymore, so my perception is that unless carmakers understand that interoperability and openness are significatively important concepts right now their relevance is compromised.

This "relevance" is not built by companies directly, but by how people that work on behalf of those companies adapt to a constantly changing world; so above technology, human factor is still a key issue in every business aspects.

Auditory was almost full of high-level executives who were talking about how to use new technologies to "connect cars", but almost none of them used the available channels to "connect people" to spread the word of the innumerable benefits of Telematics and to hear back from consumers. An objective metric of this affirmation, is that suggested [#TUlatam Twitter hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tulatam?f=realtime) had almost no activity.

It was said there: "disruption is a moving target"; are we following the movement in LATAM?
