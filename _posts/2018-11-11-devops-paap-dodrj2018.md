I get to know the term DevOps a few years ago but even I have it as a buzz word in [my CV](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6266508606087196672), before this weekend that I attended the fantastic [RioDevOpsDays](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-rio-de-janeiro) I never invested so many hours together to deep dive into DevOps

It was nice to learn that it seems I started on a good direction as first initiative was to build a monitoring and alerting solution.

Thanks [Gabriela Dias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabydias/) for the link to [State of DevOps Report](https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/state-of-devops-report). Yes I‚Äôm guilty, I never heard about it before. What gives me hope is that I know that I‚Äôm not the only one with a big techie reading/watching wish list waiting on a queue that only gets bigger every day; and surely this event broke the growth trend of that queue.

I‚Äôm confident that I already overcome the *firemen phase* but there‚Äôs long way to go to reach the *SRE Engineer* nirvana phase mentioned on [Marcelo Bellinaso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbellinaso/) excelent [presentation](https://twitter.com/mbellinasoUS/status/1061280553012473856 ).

It is nice and addicting to learn and apply new [tools and ideas](https://xebialabs.com/periodic-table-of-devops-tools); by my brief but intensive experiences I‚Äôm convinced that the most important things for this *digital transformation* backed by devops [are above Layer 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_8) and that was very well defined in the event as **PaaP**

My idea to attend the event was just to learn from what others are doing, but by the enthusiasm of [Rafael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbgomes/) putting **PaaP** in practice it is expected that we‚Äôll have the first **#MVD_DevOpsDays** in 2019.
